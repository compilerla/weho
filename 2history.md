title: "Part 2: West Hollywood innovations–
A history of civic creativity"
---

<p class="message">West Hollywood is The Creative City—innovation is in our DNA. Despite its small geography, West Hollywood has become one of the most influential small cities in the nation. The progressive spirit of the City is evident in its many groundbreaking accomplishments during the 30 years since it established Cityhood in 1984.</p>

In 1984, the first West Hollywood City Council established West Hollywood as the first City in the nation to have a majority openly gay governing body. This was a landmark development in LGBT rights globally and in the United States.

The ordinances adopted by the West Hollywood City Council within the first year of Cityhood included landmark legislation such as the City’s Rent Stabilization Ordinance (which, upon its adoption was one of the strictest rent control laws in the country); an ordinance prohibiting discrimination against people with HIV and AIDS; a Domestic Partnership Ordinance; and an ordinance prohibiting discrimination in employment based on sexual orientation. Today, many of the City’s landmark ordinances have been duplicated and have become mainstream policies nationally and globally.


In 1985, the City Council established its Social Services program to provide much-needed services to residents. Over its history, the City has provided millions of dollars in grants to fund programs for people in need. Today, the City’s Social Services Division budgets approximately $5 million per year in funding to support to programs that impact thousands of people in West Hollywood; City residents live longer and have lower rates of chronic diseases than residents of L.A. County as a whole.

The City of West Hollywood was one of the first government entities to provide social services grants to local AIDS and HIV organizations. The City sponsored one of the first AIDS awareness campaigns in the country in October 1985 and the City’s response to the AIDS crisis has been recognized as a model for other cities, nationally and globally. The City has been one of the most outspoken advocates for the legal rights of LGBT people. In 1985, the City of West Hollywood was one of the first cities in the country to adopt a Domestic Partnership Ordinance.

In October 2014, the City marked an exciting milestone as the City Clerk’s office at West Hollywood City Hall filed its 10,000th couple as registered Domestic Partners. The City also created the nation’s first municipal Transgender Task Force in 2001; in 2009 this became the City’s Transgender Advisory Board.

West Hollywood was one of the first cities in the country to pass a resolution in support of marriage equality, paving the way for same-sex marriage initiatives all over the county. In a monumental moment in U.S. history, the City, in conjunction with the Los Angeles County Register-Recorder Clerk, began to issue marriage licenses and perform civil ceremonies for same- sex couples in June 2008, following the Supreme Court of California ruling on Proposition 8. After a legal stay, in June 2013 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed an appeal in Hollingsworth v. Perry and the City of West Hollywood launched a marriage celebration. West Hollywood City Councilmembers and City Officials performed hundreds of civil ceremonies.

While blazing a trail on progressive policy issues, the City of West Hollywood has also received high marks for sound general and fiscal management policies. The City, with its diverse revenue base, recovered more quickly from the 2008 recession than most cities in the nation and receives top ratings from agencies such as Standard & Poor’s (S&P). During the past five years, the City’s revenues have steadily increased and have now surpassed pre-recession revenue levels by 12%. The City has invested in a series of leading-edge Capital Projects, including an automated parking garage and implementation of the West Hollywood Park Master Plan. In 2011, the City celebrated the opening of the new LEED-rated West Hollywood Library to showcase the City’s rich intellectual, literary, and cultural diversity. A new Aquatic and Recreation Center is currently in design development.

The City is passionate about adopting fresh new ideas and the latest in technological advancement. At West Hollywood City Hall, staff members have formed an Innovation Catalyst Group (ICG), which explores the development and implementation of groundbreaking civic ideas and technology. The City, through this group, has launched initiatives such as a monthly TEDx lunch series for City Hall staff members and has laid the groundwork for exciting new resources such as a Geographic Information Systems (GIS) initiative, an Open Data initiative, and a new web-based platform for civic engagement.

West Hollywood has a robust history of civic innovation and citizen engagement. A summary of selected past and current programs follows:

### Transportation, Pedestrian Safety, and Parking

West Hollywood has developed award-winning transportation innovations, making it one of the most walkable and accessible small cities in the country.

#### Public transit and alternative transit
The City of West Hollywood operates two transportation systems, the Cityline and The PickUp. The Cityline is West Hollywood’s main public transportation system. The shuttle route, from Beverly Blvd. and San Vicente Blvd. to Fountain Ave. and La Brea Ave., generally follows Santa Monica Blvd., deviating from the boulevard to serve the majority of the city’s neighborhoods. Shuttles run approximately every 30 minutes, Monday through Sunday from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., and are ADA compliant. Cityline has partnered with NextBus to provide real-time arrival information. The PickUp runs from 8:00 p.m. to 3:00 a.m. on Friday and Saturday nights. Its route runs from Almont Dr. to Fairfax Ave. along Santa Monica Blvd. Shuttles arrive roughly every 15 minutes and stop every two to three blocks. The PickUp, which is intended to provide an alternative to driving and to support West Hollywood nightlife, features music curated by a local DJ and offers a variety of perks, including discounts at local businesses. Additional hours and route extensions are planned in 2015. In addition to patrons of the CIty’s bars and restaurants that the PickUp was designed to serve, it has become a valuable transportation option to hospitality industry workers.

#### Walk+Bike WeHo
Since spring 2013, the City has hosted a series of community meetings, workshops, walking tours and bike rides, to gather input for an update to the City’s Pedestrian and Bicycle Mobility Plan. In the summer of 2013, the Community Development Department launched an interactive map of the City for the Plan- asking locals and visitors to post ideas on walking and biking in West Hollywood. Working with the non- profit technology based advocacy organization OpenPlans, the “share your ideas” map visually (and digitally) linked comments to geographic locations - creating a rich data set of ideas to inform future pedestrian and bike improvements.

#### Employee bike share program
n 2015, the City launched an Employee Bike Share Pilot Program, “West Hollywood Bikes@Work,” that makes bikes available to City of West Hollywood employees on a short-term basis during work hours for traveling to/from satellite parking garages, work-related meetings, and wellness rides. The program is intended to encourage fun, physical activity, and alternative modes of transportation among employees.

#### Pedestrian safety innovation
The City launched a comprehensive public safety media campaign in October 2014 including transit-shelter ads located throughout the City and large electronic and traditional billboards on Santa Monica Boulevard, the Sunset Strip, and key gateway locations for West Hollywood. The campaign features three distinct ads that exemplify the civic creativity of our City:

* **Wink, Then Walk** features a handsome shirtless man who is walking and approaching a crosswalk — “Make eye contact with drivers before you cross the street” urges the ad, “what happens next is up to you.”
* **Look, Don’t Like** displays a distracted driver who is thumbing through a social media app while holding a smart phone — “Watch the street, not the screen,” suggests the billboard, “you might like what you see in the crosswalk.”
* **Ride, Don’t Race** displays an attractive young woman racing past the library on a bicycle – “Stop at signs and signals,” the ad reminds cyclist, that they too must obey the rules of the road, “you never know who is around the next corner.”

There are also **Wink/Look/Ride** ads on social media and web-based placements in a variety of online publications as well as on mobile apps. The billboards and ads were produced by the City’s Public Information Division, which contracted with Jim Pietras Creative and Melinda Risolo of DMR Creative Services for the development of the ads. Additional plans are in progress for a bicyclist safety ad, as well.

#### Pedestrian safety spectacular/ PSA
The crosswalk safety video, Alice in WeHoLand, was produced by the City’s Public Information Division and conceived by YouTube sensation Todrick Hall. The dance-filled video offers viewers a colorful twist about curbing smartphone use and walking and driving safely. The video features a vibrant cast of characters with drag performers, gym-bunnies, models, go-go boys, and dancers who perform a pulsating choreographed routine in West Hollywood’s iconic Rainbow Crosswalks, as well as other recognizable locations throughout the City.

In April 2015, the City of West Hollywood won a first-place award for Best Government Social Media Campaign at the 2015 Government Social Media Conference & Expo (GSMCON) in Reno, Nevada. The City was recognized with a Golden Post Award for excellence in its social media efforts to promote pedestrian safety and, specifically, for its Alice
in WeHoLand YouTube safety video. To date, the video has received over 1,000,000 views.

#### Crosswalk Improvements
West Hollywood’s Rainbow Crosswalks at the intersection of Santa Monica and San Vicente Boulevards are the world’s first permanent Rainbow Crosswalks. Since their installation in 2012, they have garnered worldwide attention and have become an iconic symbol of hope, pride and acceptance for the LGBT community. Additionally, the City has rolled out measures to improve unsignalized crosswalks along Santa Monica Boulevard. Enhancements included in-street pedestrian crosswalk signage, which are bright neon yellow vertical signs posted at street-center
to warn drivers that it is “State Law to Yield to Pedestrians in Crosswalk,” and reflective raised pavement markers installed at the leading edge of crosswalks, which help to alert motorists of crosswalk locations and slow traffic.

#### Parking innovation
All parking meters in the City of West Hollywood are smart parking meters that accept payment by credit card. According to the Parking Division, credit card payments make up about 70% of all transactions at smart parking meters.

#### Automated parking garage plan
The City of West Hollywood has awarded a $2.6 million contract to Unitronics to design, engineer, fabricate, install and maintain a 200-car automated vehicle storage and retrieval system for the West Hollywood City Hall Automated Garage and Community Plaza Project. Automated parking facilities use computer-controlled, motorized vertical lifts and horizontal shuttles to move vehicles from the arrival level to a remote parking space for storage without human assistance. The driver leaves the vehicle in an area known as the “entry compartment” where sensors determine the size and dimensions of the vehicle. The driver then pulls a ticket or swipes their monthly parking card to activate the storage process. The vehicle then proceeds to the final storage location. Upon retrieval, the driver presents their card or ticket at the parking activation station. The vehicle is automatically retrieved. The driver is then directed by electronic signs to the correct exit compartment to pick up their vehicle. During the retrieval process, the vehicle is rotated so that it is facing forward for ease of exiting the facility. The entire process takes approximately two minutes. The garage is scheduled to open by Winter 2015.

#### Shared public parking valet program
West Hollywood is testing a shared, universal city-wide valet that operates valet stands throughout the city. All transactions are done digitally and customers can have their cars retrieved at a different point than where they dropped off, encouraging walking and greater exploration of local businesses.

#### ParkMe App
The City is testing out services with private provider ParkMe, a mobile application that maps real-time availability of parking spots in both public and private lots.

#### Online parking services
Parking citations can now be paid, contested, and tracked online, improving the customer service experience for community members and improving city staff efficiency.

### Recreation, Health, and Wellness

The population of West Hollywood expects best-in-class health and wellness opportunities, and the City is creating amazing new facilities in response. In addition to health and wellness, the City offers a compassionate response and many services to its residents living with HIV and AIDS. A list of innovative health programs includes:

#### West Hollywood Park Aquatic and Recreation Center
Now in Phase II of development, the West Hollywood Park Master Plan includes plans for additional park open space, development of a new aquatic recreation and community center with gymnasium and park support facilities, and children’s playground areas, including both a competition pool and a recreational pool planned for the rooftop of the new gym. An AIDS Monument, to be located near the entrance to the West Hollywood Library, is also included in the new development plan.

#### Edible Parkway Gardening
The City of West Hollywood encourages residents to plant and get the most from public parkway strips. The parkway strip is the area between the sidewalk and the curb. It is public property and, with the exception of the City’s trees, it is a resident’s personal responsibility to beautify and maintain. The City has prepared guidelines to help residents to transform their parkways into organic edible gardens.

#### Israel-West Hollywood HIV/AIDS Task Force
This Task Force is built on the strategic cooperation agreement signed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with California Governor Jerry Brown on Wednesday, March 5, 2014, which promotes intergovernmental partnerships between Israel and California. The West Hollywood City Council unanimously agreed to the establishment of the Task Force at its meeting on Monday, July 21, 2014.

#### WeHo Cares
Under the banner of “WeHo Cares,” the Social Services Division provides social services, health education and information to the community to improve the quality of life for those in need. Services include necessities of life such as food and shelter; AIDS education; preschool education for young children; job placement; legal services; mental health services; and homeless services. Services are provided via contracts with local non-profits and by the city itself. Programs serve seniors, people living with AIDS, gay men, lesbians, families with children, immigrants and people living with disabilities. The staff oversees social service contracts totaling over $3 million annually by performing program and financial audits, contract management and administrative support. Staff provides crisis intervention and information, and referral to constituents who call or walk in to City Hall.

#### WeHoLife

#### Senior Health Fair
The Senior Health Fair, held every May and now in its 14th year, features demonstrations, free health screenings, and information from a variety of community organizations. This is part of West Hollywood’s annual series of events to engage its thriving population of older community members. The tradition is rooted in President John F. Kennedy’s national designation of “Senior Citizens Month” in 1963; in 1980 President Jimmy Carter renamed it “Older Americans Month.”
